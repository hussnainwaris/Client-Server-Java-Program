Introduction:

In this project, we were asked to create a client-server Java program. Where, client sends server a user and his notes. The server records them and saves it. Server moreover, offers client to search for any existing username and his notes.

Working:
The server starts listening to a port number (<65536), in my case it is (8001). The Client requests the server for a connection and the server will accept it. For a new record, the client asks for username and notes and then sends it server. For retrieval case, the client asks for username and in return provides all entries against it.

How to Run:
-	Run the server.
-	Run the client and follow the menu.
-	To end, First close the server then client.
